# Slammin News!  

## This project is to unite people who are fans of wrestling. It includes a news aggregator as well as sign in through Firebase using Google or email. After signed in a user can enter a chat room that is put together through nosql Firebase database.  

## Setup and Usage  
[Setup a Firebase account and project](http://mariechatfield.com/tutorials/firebase/step1.html)  
In the services folder there is a Firebase.js file to update your config information including apiKey, AuthDomain, and Database Path which for this project is the real time database in Firebase  
You will also need to sign up for a Newscatcher API key for the news section of the project. [Can be found here](https://newscatcherapi.com/)  

List of Dependencies  
* firebase  
* bootstrap for react  
* react-dom  
* react-router-dom  

## Hosting
Feel free to host where you want BUT since the database is hosted through Firebase I found it easier to host there. [Read more about hosting on Firebase](https://firebase.google.com/docs/hosting)  

## Customizing
I got my logo through [a free logo creator](https://logomakr.com/) so feel free to use whatever image you want for the logo. I made the coming soon logo from the Profile Page in a basic photoshop alternative.
